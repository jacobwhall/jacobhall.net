Eating cold turkey out of a plastic bag<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;on a <a onclick="link([9])" href="#">Tuesday night</a>, my thoughts (if<br>
I have any) tend to fall somewhere between<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;terror and exhaustion.<br><br>

Nobody is dead and the stock market<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;is doing fine, but still I tremble and<br>
I can&#39;t tell why&#8212;the reasons must have<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;left me, just like you did.<br><br>

This is the idiom and I am the idiot:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I hope the night holds you softer,<br>
provides you solace, and lets you sleep<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;like you <a onclick="link([4])" href="#">so seldom do</a>.<br><br>

I hope I learn to see it the right way,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;understanding that some things don&#39;t<br>
add up, and it&#39;s best not to take<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;arithmetic personally.<br><br>

And I hope you know, however brief<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and however bothersome it is,<br>
however bizarre and uncanny it feels<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to slide into a new mask each year,<br><br>

none of it is regrettable. Nobody is entirely<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;lost or entirely put together, <a onclick="link([2,4])" href="#">nobody</a><br>
can justify everything they&#39;e done, nobody has<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;really deserved the oxygen they take up,<br><br>

and it is fine.  Ten years from now it won&#39;t matter<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;what you choose, forsake, and forget about:<br>
the earth&#39;s still spinning, god&#39;s still dead&#8212;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;everyone is always moving on.
