You've found my website's source code! Thanks for stopping by.

This website has been years in the making, and I have huge dreams for what it might become.
It started out as a static site, and grew over time to do increasingly complex things.
In 2022 things had gotten too disorganized, so I rewrote the whole thing in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

Next on the roadmap are a series of social features.
I'm building a set of [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) services so that I can interact with other personal sites, and I might also add Fediverse support.

Someday, I want to make this project available as a template for others to use.
The building blocks will all be open-source and customizable, from the database to the HTML.
As the different pieces mature, I'll likely break them into different projects, and link them together with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) or similar.

After that, I'll experiment with creating a [tilde community](https://tildeverse.org/) that hosts customizable personal sites for people using these IndieWeb building blocks.
The idea is that we'll be able to use, maintain, and improve the same tools together on the same server.
Over time, we'll make it easier for less technical users to join and use our tools to express themselves freely.
I've started to draft my plan for this community [here](https://farm.jacobhall.net).

If you're interested in any of this, please reach out!
Meeting new people is one of my favorite things to do, and one of my primary goals in building this site, so please don't hesitate to send me an email.
I'm open to any PRs, but highly recommend you talk to me first so that we can coordinate our efforts.
