i often reimage my computers, and it's nice to have a list of software that i should install. at some point i might write a master dnf command that will install everything at once.
</p>
<p>i've added some commentary about some of these programs in case you're interested</p>
    <h1>software i use</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Firefox - Mozilla is doing great things to keep the internet open and free, and the latest versions of Firefox are wicked fast and arguably more standards-compliant than certain other browsers!</li>
		<li>Inkscape - i've gotten really excited about SVGs recently and Inkscape is super easy to learn and a joy to use. fingers crossed that the SVG 2.0 standard gets adopted!</li>
		<li>GIMP - my high school-issued laptop came with Photoshop installed, and i was admittedly hesitant about GIMP as an alternative. since then GIMP has improved greatly, and i've become much more comfortable using it</li>
		<li>LaTeX - there really is a steep learning curve here, but every time i learn how to do something new in LaTeX i feel one step closer to becoming a wizard</li>
		<li>RStudio - i really love R, and RStudio makes R really fun. i've started playing with Knitr, and it's hella tight. 10/10</li>
		<li>Calibre - i don't love how bloated this program feels but at the end of the day it makes keeping an ebook library a breeze</li>
		<li>Jellyfin - great self-hosted movie/tv show library</li>
		<li>Retroarch - i've gotten into emulating old console games recently, and so far i've been pleased with how well Retroarch performs. i'll probably write an article about it at some point</li>
		<li>Dolphin - emulator for GameCube and Wii, so far i've had good experiences</li>
	</ul>
	<h1>Firefox extensions i use</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>uBlock Origin - it seems that everyone agrees this is the best ad blocker. thanks Gorhill!</li>
		<li>HTTPS Everywhere - in the last couple of years pretty much everything on the web has transitioned to HTTPS, and its nice to know when i'm accessing an unsecured site</li>
		<li>Bitwarden - i'm not married to this password manager, but so far no complaints. i might experiment with self-hosting it in the future</li>
		<li>Metastream Remote - metastream has been a great site for watching stuff with friends during the coronavirus</li>
	</ul>
<h1>software i'd like to learn</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Blender</li>
		<li>open-source CAD?</li>
	</ul>
<h1>software i'm looking for</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>
		a music player for linux to fall in love with. it has to:
			<ul>
				<li>be open source</li>
				<li>be blazing fast and stable</li>
				<li>keep my music organized</li>
				<li>support ID3 tags</li>
			</ul>
		the solution might be Jellyfin, or beets. still considering the options
		</li>
	</ul>
