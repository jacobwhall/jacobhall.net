I suppose magic must happen for somebody,<br>
in whatever form you think it takes&#8212;<br>
although I wonder if it was ever recognized,<br>
if anyone has ever known they were enchanted.<br><br>

Maybe it is a kind of gunk that builds up<br>
at the bottom of lives, a thing that grows<br>
unnoticed on the drywall, a thing that&#39;s<br>
left for two weeks in the sink unwashed.<br><br>

Or maybe it is like dust, a thing that visits<br>
lonely surfaces, keeping their untouched<br>
edges covered, drifting ubiquitously<br>
in the air: content, meticulous, and entire.<br><br>

It must be part-invisible like that&#8212;<a onclick="link([2,10])" href="#">easy</a><br>
to miss, easy to forget about, so easy<br>
it goes undetected.  Never <a onclick="link([2,3])" href="#">fast</a> and never<br>
gone, I wish I knew it already.
