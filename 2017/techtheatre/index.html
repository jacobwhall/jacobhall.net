<h1>Technical Theatre Work</h1>
<p>

</p>
<p>
As student technical director of the program this year, I am responsible for making the technical side of our productions come together, including 10 student-directed and 2 faculty-directed productions. With fellow students producing and designing each of these shows, much of my job is to lead and mentor others. Please note that I am only listing my major technical roles, and not including my acting credits.

<h2>Project Example: Tower Projections</h2>

<p>The middle school musical this year was an adaption of Shakespeare&#8217;s <i>King John</i>, featuring costumes inspired by &quot;high fashion,&quot; bold LED lighting, and prop swords designed to evoke tasers. The production&#8217;s concept involved a large medieval tower center-stage, on which projections of various characters would appear.</p>
<p>My setup involved a projector that already existed in the space, refocused to cover the front surface of the tower. I set up a custom surface in QLab using b&eacute;zier curves to account for the curved tower, and then designed the images and video to be projected in Photoshop and Final Cut Pro X. </p>
<p>One of the most dramatic moments of the show is when Arthur, rightful heir to the English throne, falls off of a tower to his death. After my plans to install a crash mat under the tower were shot down, I was asked to instead create a falling silouette video to project onto the side of the tower. This task took a lot of preparation: I had to imagine what a free-falling silouette might look like, set up a video shoot, and then work with the actress playing Arthur to create the effect. I had the actress lay on a stool and flail her arms and legs, as I moved the camera around her to make her appear to be turning in the air. In post I keyed out the background, and keyframed her silouette to &quot;fall&quot; down the screen. (See right for finished video)</p>
<p>The other major projections I had to design were a series of portraits of different characters, to be projected as they were introduced to the audience. The most important aspect of this project was to cooperate with the hair/makeup artists, who I needed to prepare each of the actors and actresses for their photo shoot. I also worked closely with the director, making sure the subjects were posing appropriately, and holding props that would make sense. After taking the portraits, I added golden frames to them in Photoshop.</p>
