When we found him lying on the ground<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;barely <a onclick="link([2,10])" href="#">breathing</a>, body still, <a onclick="link([4])" href="#">wings</a> broken<br>
I looked up what we were supposed to do:<br><br>

The internet said an injured owl should be put<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;in a dark and silent place such as<br>
a cardboard box with breathing holes.<br><br>

I poked out the holes and they wrapped <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;him in their <a onclick="link([4,5,9])" href="#">flannel</a>.  He could only move<br>
his eyes. I put him inside and closed the flaps.<br><br>

As I did that, I thought of you again<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and I began to worry as I always do,<br>
began to wonder if you were the owl<br><br>

or if I was the owl.  Most likely<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am the box, since I am made of<br>
cardboard (I don&#39;t know if you know this yet)<br><br>

I tear, I fold, I try again, and if<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;you look close you&#39;ll see all these<br>
holes poked through my skin.<br><br>

Last night as I leafed through the books<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;on your bedside table, I felt myself fall open:<br>
and all of me was filled so suddenly<br><br>

by the sharp and vivid sight of us<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;hoping and stumbling through the world,<br>
this heart of mine so far so near so flung<br><br>

by whatever we believe does the flinging.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I know in the end you are not the owl<br>
and I am not the box, nor is the reverse<br><br>

true at all. There is no fable to find here,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;just a cardboard box, a dirty flannel,<br>
and a dead <a onclick="link([3,5])" href="#">bird</a> we will both forget about.
