<a onclick="link([4])" href="#">Last night, tenth of May</a>, the <a onclick="link([3,4])" href="#">angels</a><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;must have been elsewhere.  I called<br>
you to speculate about my going<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;back home, making another amend, and I hope<br>
you heard me.<br><br>

Ask after a savior and leave a<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;message at the tone, wait for the time<br>
to come around, give me a reason<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to keep my word&#8212;let me know&#8212;say<br>
you hear me.<br><br>

If you remember the night I<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;introduced you to country music,<br>
<a onclick="link([2,5])" href="#">driving</a> to Shenandoah, <a onclick="link([3])" href="#">I-81</a>&#8212;do you&#8212;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;would you&#8212;come around, listen,<br>
you&#39;ll hear me.<br><br>

This afternoon, this <a onclick="link([8])" href="#">Tuesday</a><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;entropy empty bank account<br>
kind of afternoon, a revelation<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;fought its way into my life:<br>
it stood right there<br><br>

at the <a onclick="link([3,6])" href="#">doorway</a>, and it wore your<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;old <a onclick="link([1,4,5])" href="#">flannel</a>. I will miss you longer<br>
than I will have known you,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;this much is sure.  I am more<br>
like a crow than a <a onclick="link([6])" href="#">bluebird</a>.
