&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;so often, you told me, we ask our little<br>
grand questions and end up sounding like idiots<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;or worse&#8212;so often, you said, we end up<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;staring at <a onclick="link([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])" href="#">ceilings instead of skies</a>&#8212;<br>
and when I told you that line was good enough to steal,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;you said you already knew I&#39;d take it.
