	What is Jacob up to these days?
</p>
<p>
	I'm living in Williamsburg, VA studying at William &amp; Mary. I plan to move to San Francisco this year with my partner Alyssa.

<p>
	I'm getting really excited about the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>, and how I can design my own website to interact with others' comfortably
</p>
<p>
	I'm splitting my time between the following jobs:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Research Assistant at AidData</strong>
		<p>
			I am working under <a href="https://www.aiddata.org/people/seth-goodman">Seth Goodman</a> writing code that handles geospatial data for <a href="https://www.aiddata.org/geoquery">GeoQuery</a>
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Radon Research Project</strong>
		<p>
			My undergraduate thesis at William &amp; Mary will be a video describing radon as a health hazard to Williamsburg homeowners. I am researching radon's presence in the area, and writing a script for the video

</ul>
