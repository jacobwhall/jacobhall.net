<h2>On the future of this site, and a video I really like</h2>
<p>I'm not entirely sure I'm satisfied with my last post, and every time I read it over I find myself editing it a bit to reflect my current feelings.
I want this site to be somewhat forgiving in that way: a place where I can self-publish random thoughts, photos, and links that I want to share or hear other opinions on.
In other words, I want this to be my social medium.</p>
<p>I've been reading about the "<a href="https://indieweb.org/">Indie Web</a>," a movement of independent web developers who want to feel more control over how they publish and share things on their own websites.
This movement is pushing for a standard by which any website can "mention" another, in the form of a comment or repost.
This concept of a "webmention" has been written up as an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">official W3C recommendation</a>, and there are numerous active projects focused on implementing webmentions.</p>
<p>I'm not sure webmentions have the potential for widespread adoption. Personal websites are rare, and it's hard for me to imagine webmentions integrating well with the social networks most people are using right now, even if those companies embraced the idea for some reason.
Without that integration, who am I trying to reach by implementing webmentions in the first place?
It would only make sense if I only wanted to talk to others who get excited by webmentions.</p>
<p>There are a few social networks on the brink of mainstream adoptability right now, all connected using a common protocol called ActivityPub (also <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">a W3C recommendation</a>). Through ActivityPub, networks of any type hosted by anyone can all share amongst themselves, creating a "federated" network. For example, <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> is essentially a Twitter clone, but federated through ActivityPub. Individual servers running Mastodon can decide their own rules when it comes to their users, the content they post, and the other servers they can interact with.
The magic of this federation isn't really among Mastodon servers, but instead the ability for anyone within the Mastodon network to interact with literally any account created in any network that also uses ActivityPub.
Whether it's <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">an Instagram clone</a> or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/">Wordpress site</a>, if it supports ActivityPub, someone with a Mastodon account can comment or share their post, and vice versa.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with my website? My plan is to find a way to implement ActivityPub here, on posts like this one. I know it won't solve the problem of interacting with Twitter or Facebook, but it will open the door for anyone to interact with it if they want to. You won't have to make your own website to webmention this one, or be forced into one company's terms of service to say hi to me online. If you want to interact with me, you can decide between a plethora of diverse, ethically-moderated communities that will enable you to connect with me. And of course, I'll still have an email if you don't want to do that!</p>
<p>Who knows when this will actually happen (I already tried to do it once and got frustrated), but it'll probably be in the next few months.
I'm currently thinking <a href="https://microblog.pub/">microblog.pub</a> would fit my needs best, and I think it has the potential to still feel like my internet home with a few CSS tweaks.
I'd appreciate any thoughts you might have on this!</p>
<p>Unrelated to any of that, I recommend this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_b67WgH6Vs">"i only feel valuable when i succeed and i should cut that out" by Savannah Brown</a></p>

<h2>Some thoughts on social media and online art</h2>
<p>
I've been thinking a lot recently about my relationship with technology, and what exactly I want out of my interactions with my phone and computer.
It's becoming clearer to me that despite the unimaginable amount of information, entertainment, and discourse available on the internet, so much of the content I end up consuming every day feels dull and unmemorable.
One of the things that bothers me most about the internet is how most search engines and social networks try their best to serve me content related to content I've already seen.
</p>

<p>
I've heard a lot of arguments against social media recently.
Many people are upset about Facebook or Twitter having too much political power, collecting too much data about their users, or acting in anti-competitive ways.
To be honest, I largely disagree with those arguments.
Unless their government or service provider is censoring content (which I believe is wrong), anyone who the internet has complete control over what sites they choose to visit, what browser they use, etc.
How you interact with the internet is entirely your decision, and websites can do whatever they like with the data you provide them.
So, how will I solve this problem of not enjoying my time spent on social media?
I will delete the accounts on, and more importantly stop visiting, the sites that I do not enjoy visiting.
I've gotten really excited about federated social networking recently, and I think 
</p>

<p>
I love the internet, and I love discovering content on the internet, but I want it to be a tool I only use in short bursts of maximum utility.
By that I mean that I want to log in for periods of an hour or less, and spend that time consuming high-quality, entirely novel content.
Given the sheer amount of data uploaded to the web every second, surely that would be possible?
</p>

<p>
A Google search can be unhelpful when approaching a new topic, and it can take a lot of digging to find a few good keywords.
I've noticed many times that my search results look a lot different than my friends', a phenomenon described in Eli Pariser's <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles">TED talk on "filter bubbles."</a>
News publications and link aggregators have all but solved this problem for current events and videos of cats.
But I love watching music videos, for example, and those are really hard to discover.
Youtube's recommendation algorithm is great, but there is a sense of randomness to its suggestions, and it's designed to keep me clicking.
This isn't ideal for discovering new music videos because Youtube's algorithm usually suggests videos I've seen before, videos directly related to videos I've seen before, or content that is not music videos.
The best resource I've found for finding music videos is <a href="https://imvdb.com">The Internet Music Video Database</a>, but it doesn't feel like the solution.
IMVDb isn't an open database, meaning that it can't be copied, so users are at the mercy of the owners of the site to maintain and update it.
IMDb suffers from the same problem, but with such a large userbase and the backing of Amazon, this isn't really an issue for most users.
However, IMVDb has not been responsive to my submissions and is hard to navigate/search, despite having been online <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121022172925/http://imvdb.com/">for 7 years</a>.
Any work that I contribute to it belongs to someone else.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I'll try my hand at building a music video database with open licensing and improved discovery.

<h2>What to Pack?</h2>
<p>
<strong>Clothing</strong><br>
Bring a waterproof shell: Frogg Toggs is a good budget choice, otherwise pick out something that fits you well and will last longer/roll up smaller. If you‚Äôll be out for more than a day, bring an extra shirt and pair of pants. Depending on the expected temperature, decide whether your spares should be long- or short-sleeved. Bring one pair of underwear, and only use it to help keep pants fresh for longer. I like to bring three pairs of socks because they get smelly quickly, but if you don‚Äôt have the same problem you could probably get away with alternating two (never wear them to bed unless you will be cold!). If you don‚Äôt have access to laundry machines or don‚Äôt want to use them too much, do your laundry in a sink.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Warm clothing</strong><br>
It is inevitable that you‚Äôll need more clothing for cold conditions. However, be realistic about what temperatures you will have to endure, and what preparations are appropriate. Customize your system to your preferences, body temperature, and style. My strategy is to layer a short-sleeved shirt, long-sleeved shirt, and puffy jacket, and if I need more warmth or rain protection I‚Äôll add my waterproof shell over everything. A good hat or gloves can help add more warmth without adding much weight. I think this category is the most important to reconsider before every trip.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Tools</strong><br>
Bring a 1L water bottle, a fork, a good pen, toothbrush/toothpaste, floss, nail clippers, and if you expect to drink anything other than water, a reusable straw. I love Dr. Bronner‚Äôs liquid soap, but it‚Äôs a tough decision whether or not to bring it. It‚Äôs great for hand washing/showering, sink laundry, and keeping everything else clean. On the other hand, it isn‚Äôt ever used on many trips, and potentially messy or a problem at TSA checkpoints. I‚Äôve heard a menstrual cup can be a lighter and more eco-friendly alternative to bulky feminine hygiene products, but you should bring whatever will make you most comfortable. If you carry a notebook, bring it or a smaller one. A bandana can be nice to have, especially if you will cook for yourself or have allergies. Some people love to pack a knife, but I‚Äôve never really needed one. If I‚Äôm not going through TSA I sometimes carry a small multi-tool, that has never saved the day but often been convenient. I rarely travel somewhere that don‚Äôt have dishes I could use (and I‚Äôve never seen a restaurant allow customers bring their own dishes), but if you‚Äôre going to prepare a lot of food on-the-go a lightweight metal camping bowl might come in handy, and doesn‚Äôt take up much bag space if you stuff clothes into it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Essential tech</strong><br>
Don‚Äôt bring a laptop unless you will absolutely need it. In fact, try not to bring any digital information you won‚Äôt need, especially across certain international borders. Smartphones can do almost anything you need, especially if you use Android. A smartphone can reduce your need for other items, such as a flashlight, guidebook, or e-reader. If you are headed to a region that uses different power outlets, make sure to pack the appropriate adapter. Many adapters have USB output, which can help you reduce the total number of adapters and cables you need. If your phone supports quickcharging, consider an adapter that is quickcharge compatible. One other thing to consider is paying for a VPN service, to help protect yourself when using the internet on public wifi, a cellular connection, or in certain countries.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Non-essential tech</strong><br>
Be judicious about what other gadgets you pack. I‚Äôd recommend bringing no more than two, and only if you truly have room for them in a small backpack. For me, that might be a nice pair of over-ear headphones or my old Kindle. If you‚Äôll be away from power for more than a day, consider a power bank. Most modern TVs (in hotels, friends‚Äô houses, etc.) have USB ports meant for USB sticks. If you have a digital media collection, you consider loading a USB stick with some movies. You could even sync movies from your phone to the USB stick!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Wallet</strong><br>
Don‚Äôt bring that bulky wallet! Bring whatever payment methods you might need, bound by a rubber band. You might also need a public transportation or library card. A driver‚Äôs license might also be useful if you need to...drive! If you don‚Äôt need your passport, another form of ID might be a good idea.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Sleeping</strong><br>
I don‚Äôt carry a travel pillow, but you should pack what you need to ensure a good night‚Äôs sleep. A pair of earplugs can also be valuable in a pinch. If you will ever not have a bed, bring a CCF sleeping pad if its bulkiness won‚Äôt bother you, otherwise bring a quality ultralight inflatable pad. If you will be camping or somewhere weirdly cold or you hate sleeping in clothes, you‚Äôre going to need a sleeping bag or quilt. I like to keep mine in a stuff sack to make sure it stays dry no matter what, and can be a makeshift pillow if filled with air and packed back into your bag with your clothes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Backcountry</strong><br>
If you won‚Äôt have access to common amenities, there are a few other items you should consider. There are many different ways to purify water, so if that might be a concern for you do your research. If you will be pooping in the backcountry, bring a trowel for digging catholes and toilet paper (kept dry!). If you will be spending much time outside in the dark, you might prefer a headlamp to conserve your phone‚Äôs charge or for ergonomics. If you‚Äôll need your own shelter, decide whether a single tarp or full tent would work best for your trip. A sheet of Tyvek can be cut down into a cheap and durable tarp or ground sheet. Tents vary greatly, so make sure to consider your budget, number of occupants, trip weather conditions, etc. Some tents can use a trekking pole instead of separate tent poles. It may be worth buying lighter stakes. You may also want to bring parachute cord or something similar for hanging a tarp, bear bag, or clothes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>First-aid and medical</strong><br>
It‚Äôs always good to have some band-aids and OTC painkillers with you at the very least. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is also a good idea for many, as it can function both as an antihistamine and sleep aid. Surgical tape or gauze might also be valuable. Consciously decide what other first-aid supplies you might realistically need based on the context of your trip, any medical background you may have, and your risk tolerance. If you have any medications, epinephrine injectors, or other required personal items, be creative about packing them small.</p>

<h2>How to Read Everything for Free</h2>
        <p>Ebooks sound like the ultimate freedom: any book, downloaded immediately to your device at the tap of a finger.
I remember Kindles being a hot holiday gift back when I was in 8th grade (2012), but after only a few months I rarely saw anyone reading one.
Sure enough, e-reader sales peaked in 2011 and have been declining ever since.<sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272740/global-shipments-of-e-book-readers/">1</a></sup>
There seem to be a few reasons why e-readers lost their popularity.
Some people don't read at all,<sup><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/23/who-doesnt-read-books-in-america/">2</a></sup> and perhaps those who do would rather read paper than an "e-ink display."
I've personally been frustrated by my library's ebook selection, and the books that do look interesting have already been "checked out" (a silly idea when it's just a file!).
Buying an ebook costs a lot, if not as much as a new paper book than definitely more than a used one.</p>

<p>I'd like to make the case that you should read ebooks.
If you don't own an e-reader already, it's very easy to find someone to give you theirs for free.
Their batteries last for <i>weeks</i>, and they have enough storage for countless titles.
If an e-reader doesn't sound as fantastic to you than it does to me, there are a number of great ebook reader apps available for your smartphone, including the <a href="https://koreader.rocks/">free and open-source KOReader</a>.
Ebooks are very easy to find on the internet, with many classics available for download from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/free-ebooks/">many sites</a>, including <a href="https://standardebooks.org">Standard Ebooks</a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/texts">Internet Archive</a>. If you know where to look, any ebook ever created is available online.
There is a fantastic open-source ebook management program called <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> that can keep your ebooks organized, convert them to different formats, sync them with ebook readers, and just about anything else.
If you ever want to send a book to someone, you could do it via email.
I've found a number of open source textbooks available as .epub files, and others can be converted to a format compatible with e-readers.</p>

<p>I enjoy long-distance hiking, and hope to spend as much of my life travelling as I can.
This feels like an elegant solution to the feeling of disconnect I get when I spend so much time alone or far from a library.
I'll have every book I want to read in my pocket (without the actual weight of a stack of books in my bag), I'll be able to spend more time learning, and my smartphone battery will make it to the next outlet without dying.
The only thing I need to work out is how to add books to my Kindle using my smartphone.
When I develop a simple enough workflow, I'll edit this with my findings.
Happy reading!</p>
