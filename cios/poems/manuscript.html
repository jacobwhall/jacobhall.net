&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I have been told of striped bass,<br>
and know the circles which rise from this <a onclick="link([2,3])" href="#">water</a> at dawn<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;are from those big fish feeding on flies.<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I have been told of stars,<br>
and know the ones reflected here are the same<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;you see, wherever you are.<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you are <a onclick="link([8])" href="#">up this late again</a>,<br>
you should know these are also the ones we saw<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;on the balcony that <a onclick="link([9])" href="#">night last May</a>,<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;when you borrowed my <a onclick="link([1,5,9])" href="#">flannel</a> and<br>
we watched the lights flicker off on the building<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;opposite ours, the brackish din of the party<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;flowing away as you talked about<br>
the play you were meaning to write. I wonder<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;if you ever did begin it.<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Most of us, you said, are failed<br>
messiahs.  Our manuscripts thicken like the waists<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;of American dads, our voices drift<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;over the windless air and everyone hears<br>
but <a onclick="link([2,8])" href="#">nobody listens</a>. We&#39;re in the same crisis<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;transposed two years, the same circles,<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the same stars&#8212;bowls <a onclick="link([3])" href="#">ashed</a>, pupils<br>
dilated, myths debunked, the dynamo stopped<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and the roman candles burnt to a nub.<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But haven&#39;t you always been<br> 
the one who still believed? The one who<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;loved to dance with <a onclick="link([5])" href="#">eyes closed</a>,<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;who dipped his feet in the fountain<br>
outside the art museum (ignoring the sign that<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;said you shouldn&#39;t) who asked me if<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I thought the <a onclick="link([1])" href="#">wings</a> of <a onclick="link([3,9])" href="#">angels</a> were more like<br>
those of doves or those of dragonflies, and which<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I would prefer, if either, or neither&#8212;<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the last time we saw each other, your eyes<br>
dodged mine and I wanted to ask what was wrong, but<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I never got a moment alone with you:<br><br> 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;so often, you told me, we ask our little<br>
grand questions and end up sounding like idiots<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;or worse&#8212;so often, you said, we end up<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;staring at ceilings instead of skies&#8212;<br>
and when I told you that line was good enough to steal,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;you said you already knew I&#39;d take it.
