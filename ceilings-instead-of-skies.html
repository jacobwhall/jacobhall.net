  <h1>Ceilings Instead of Skies</h1>
<p>My brilliant friend Aidan Walker wrote a collection of poems entitled <i>Ceilings Instead of Skies</i>. He proposed to me a concept for a website on which readers could explore the collection, by clicking on key words in each poem that would lead to a random poem that shared that theme.</p>
<p>I don't want to take much credit for this project: Aidan was very specific about how he'd like the poems to link together. The site is still a work in progress, but you can check it out <a href="https://wordways.us">here</a>.</p>
