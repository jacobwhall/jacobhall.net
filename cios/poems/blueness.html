I hear the rise and fall of mountains in your <a onclick="link([1,2])" href="#">breath</a> on the mornings<br>
when I wake before you do and lie there considering the day.<br>
Like an ancient range worn smooth by centuries of running<br>
against the <a onclick="link([3,5])" href="#">sky</a>, you seem to be a panorama in my mind,<br><br>

the blueness of which (the sky I mean) is also in your voice,<br>
so still and soft in the way it alters, in the way a cirrus <a onclick="link([3,6])" href="#">cloud</a> of<br>
laughter sometimes slips over it, in the way it holds the sun in place for<br>
me, in the way it always darkens right before the <a onclick="link([6])" href="#">rain</a>,<br><br>

the suddenness of which (the rain I mean) is also on your fingertips,<br>
in the way they strike and startle, in the way I am inundated when<br>
you rest your hand in mine&#8212;flash-flooded&#8212;like water it seems<br>
so <a onclick="link([2,7])" href="#">easy</a> to hold you sometimes, but really it is not.<br><br>

And I wrote this poem because it is the most polite way<br>
I can think of to tell you that you snore.
