   <h1>How to Read Everything for Free</h1>
   April 2019
	<p>The original Kindle was released in 2007.<sup><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/19/a-decade-of-amazon-kindle/">1</a></sup> In my opinion, this was one of the most powerful moments in recent literary history: Amazon, the massive book/everything seller was backing a migration to digital books. There have been a bunch of ereaders released over the years, including fairly regular Kindle updates from Amazon. It feels like the ultimate freedom: any book, downloaded immediately to your reader at the tap of a finger.</p>
<p>I remembered Kindles being a hot holiday gift back when I was in 8th grade (2012), but I haven't seen many people with one since. Sure enough, e-reader sales peaked in 2011 and have been declining ever since.<sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272740/global-shipments-of-e-book-readers/">2</a></sup> I posted an Instagram story asking if anyone would sell me their old Kindle, and received six offers.</p>
<p>I can imagine a few reasons for e-readers being unpopular. There some people who don't read at all,<sup><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/23/who-doesnt-read-books-in-america/">3</a></sup> and perhaps those who do are used to reading paper books. I've personally been frustrated by my library's ebook selection, and buying an ebook can be as expensive as buying a paper one. </p>
<p>I'd like to make the case that you should read ebooks. If you don't own an e-reader already, it's very easy to find someone to give you theirs for free. Their batteries last for <i>weeks</i>, and they can store countless titles. Ebooks are very easy to find on the internet, with many classics available for download from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/free-ebooks/">many sites</a>, including <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/texts">Internet Archive</a>. If you know where to look, any ebook ever created is available for free online. There is a fantastic free ebook management program program called <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> that can keep your ebooks organized as well as any other ebook manipulation you could imagine, including conversion to different formats and syncing with ebook readers. If you ever want to send a book to someone, you could do it via email. I've found a number of open source textbooks available as .epub files, and others can be converted to a format compatible with e-readers.</p>
<p>I enjoy long-distance hiking, and hope to spend as much of my life travelling as I can. This feels like an elegant solution to the feeling of disconnect I get when I spend so much time alone or far from a library. With every book I could think of reading in my pocket, I'll be able to spend more time learning and less time wishing I had a specific book on hand.</p>
