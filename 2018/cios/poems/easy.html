It was <a onclick="link([7,10])" href="#">easy</a>&#8212;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;unexpectedly so&#8212;<br>
there was nothing to second-guess.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;All I had to do was <a onclick="link([1,10])" href="#">breathe</a>.<br><br>  

We sat down together<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and watched the far lights of<br>
<a onclick="link([5,9])" href="#">automobiles</a> crossing the Willamette.<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It was hardly snowing by then.<br><br>

As the morning commuters<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;drove past us, the sun&#39;s reflection on<br> 
the <a onclick="link([3,4])" href="#">water</a> tripped towards us,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;yellow as yolk done over easy.<br><br>

It seemed so close I could<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;reach out my hand and touch it<br>
as readily as I could reach over<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and touch you&#8212;just as soon.<br><br>

<a onclick="link([4,8])" href="#">Nobody talked</a>,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;we felt no need. Memory<br>
reminds you how <a onclick="link([3,7])" href="#">fast</a> and sparse<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the lucky times are.
