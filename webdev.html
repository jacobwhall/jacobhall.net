	<h1>Website Development</h1>

<p>
Hi, my name is Jacob Hall, and sometimes I develop websites!
</p>
<p>
I started learning PHP way back in 7th grade, and I'd like to think my skills have improved since then üòÑ
</p>
<p>
I specialize in simple, handcrafted user experiences that deliver content in innovative ways. If that sounds interesting to you, <a href="mailto:totallyuneekemail@gmail.com">let's talk</a>!
</p>
<p>
Most recently, I built the <a href="http://173.73.66.236/">üîì Challenging Racism Secondary Curriculum site</a>, a platform for the nonprofit to share lesson materials with their licensees. I was the sole front-end developer for the project, working with Drupal.
</p>
<p>
My friend Aidan has been publishing his hypertext poetry projects on a site I've helped build entitled <a href="https://wordways.us">wordways</a>. It's been a great way to hone my JavaScript skills as he devises new ways to weave together each collection.
</p>
<p>
A high school passion project, entitled <a href="https://thehbarchive.org">The H-B Archive</a>, has slowly morphed over the years from a collection of scans from the school attic, to a carefully-curated library of media spanning the school's history. The site doubles as a testing ground for my PHP, CSS, and AWS skills as I venture into homebrew video streaming, content management, and advocacy.
</p>
<p>...but the website I work on most is my own. It has become my digital home: a place to share my thoughts, test my skills, and connect with new people. <a href="https://jacobhall.net">Let's be friends!</a>
