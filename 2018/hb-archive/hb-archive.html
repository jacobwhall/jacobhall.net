<p>A project I started in June 2017, The H-B Archive is my attempt to create an online home for the alumni, news, and historical documents of H-B Woodlawn, the secondary school I attended.</p>
<p>It's a beast, and I have huge dreams to carefully design every page with a different stylesheet to make the UX truly thought-out and unique. The website includes multiple SQL databases, to store alumni/staff contact information, as well as documents from our governing body, Town Meeting.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear what you think, and how I might be able to refine it for the future. <a href="https://thehbarchive.org">Visit The H-B Archive</a></p>
