The spires of St. Emmanuel&#39;s unpeel the air,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;exposing the space behind the <a onclick="link([5,10])" href="#">sky</a> where heaven<br>
might fit.  She straightens my tie at the <a onclick="link([6,9])" href="#">doorway</a>,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(since I don&#39;t know how to do it myself)<br>
and asks if I have seen any interesting <a onclick="link([1,5])" href="#">birds</a> lately.<br><br>

There was a vulture on <a onclick="link([9])" href="#">I-81</a>, fifteen minutes<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;north of Bristol and halfway through the James<br>
Taylor album we played for the drive up;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;it was dining on the distended corpse<br>
of what looked to be a deer (although I wasn&#39;t sure)&#8212;<br><br> 

Things pass so quickly&#8212;at seventy miles an hour,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;you can hardly get a glance in before you run<br>
on northward (<a onclick="link([2,7])" href="#">faster</a> still). I remember counting<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;pelicans with her, chasing slim sandpipers<br>
on the tightrope walk between wave and dune;<br><br>

And I remember that heron posed on the dock, gray-eyed<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and swift, like an undercover <a onclick="link([4,9])" href="#">angel</a> sent to guide us<br>
on the morning we let his <a onclick="link([4])" href="#">ashes</a> wing down<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;into the <a onclick="link([2,4])" href="#">water</a>&#8212;one bird sign is best, a dream<br>
of him crosses my mind just like a flock of geese crosses<br><br>

a <a onclick="link([6,10])" href="#">cloud</a>, returning northward (faster still) I saw<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a different bird disappear behind the belltower,<br>
scraping the sky yet leaving no scar, turning it<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the color of white lilies at the altar&#8212;you&#39;ve come just in time&#8212;<br>
this is what I have seen and what I must show you.
