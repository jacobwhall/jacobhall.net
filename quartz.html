		&Tab;In your text you mentioned your site could look like an old word processor, and I really liked that idea.
		I'm thinking there could be a fun sort of 2000s-style menubar above this "page," with navigation to various pages on your site.
		The background could be a fun texture or pattern of some sort? Probably not this brown.<br><br>
		This is where you could put content, like something you wrote<br><br>
		The vibe could be like an old word processor<br><br>
		&Tab;One interesting challenge would be how we'd format longer documents, like would this page be endless, or would it break every 11 inches? Lots to consider</p>
