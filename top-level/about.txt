<h1>about me</h1>
<p>
	Hi! My name is Jacob Hall.
	I use they/them pronouns.
<p>
<p>
	I think a lot about how people use technology to enrich their lives.
	From the maps we use to navigate, to our favorite recipes, digital tools help us remember and share the information that's most valuable to us.
	One of my biggest aspirations is to help build those tools.
</p>
<p>
	This summer 2022, I graduate from William &amp; Mary with a geology degree.
	I couldn't be more excited to explore a career that will likely incorporate my interests in science, technology, and the natural world.
	My long-term goal is to become a teacher, bringing my media and communication skills into the classroom.
</p>
<p>
	A few fun facts about me:

		<li>I'm a notary public for the commonwealth of virginia</li>
		<li>I starred as a starfish in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2SBlWhh7hE">short movie musical</a></li>
	</ul>
<p>
	The primary goal of this website is to connect with other people, so please be in touch!

	<h1>about this site</h1>

<p>
	I've designed this website for myself, as a record of things I like and ideas I'm excited about.
	Its larger goal is to be a sort of interface with the internet, helping me to connect with interesting people Out There.
</p>
<p>
	The site's vision has changed a lot over the years.
	At first I built it as simply as possible, with entirely inline styles and no dynamic elements.
	Nowadays it's a lot more complex, with a custom Racket backend that allows me to define its behavior.
	Most of my posts are organized in a database, and pages like this one are generated using templates.
	But everything is still meticulously handcrafted; this site represents my opinion of what a blog should be.
	I feel that everyone deserves an internet experience designed to their tastes!
</p>
