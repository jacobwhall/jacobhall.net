&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This checkout girl last <a onclick="fade()" href="javascript:void(0);">night</a><br>
at Wild Birds Unlimited had the same<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;first name as you, although<br>
she spelled it kind of differently.<br><br> 

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I read it on the tag pinned<br>
to her lapel, and I remembered how<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;you never thought it suited you<br>
and wished you had a different one.<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This girl, she told me to insert my<br>
card because it needed the chip reader&#8212;<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I&#39;d swiped instead&#8212;I still forget&#8212;<br>
she brought me back&#8212;I still remember&#8212;<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the evening you watched me<br>
struggle to unbutton my flannel shirt,<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;wrapped in the calico buzz of<br>
the woods at  <a onclick="fade()" href="javascript:void(0);">night</a>, crickets and whip&#8212;<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;poor-wills, blended sound of<br>
dark and wet and soft with the croon<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;of the highway we&#39;d come from<br>
stretched over me like sky, eyes closed.<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Five days until summer and your<br>
fingers still cold from the Yuengling<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;you&#39;d opened and continued to sip at<br>
while you went down on me.<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Some stunt.  I didn&#39;t understand<br>
how I was supposed to react to it.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You told me how well the other boys<br>
had done, you asked if you could smoke.<br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I don&#39;t mind.  I pulled out with<br>
my bag of birdseed in the same backseat,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;turned on some music to blunt the<br>
racket of my thoughts&#8212;nevermind.
