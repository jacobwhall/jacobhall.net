<h2>‚úèÔ∏è How to Read Everything for Free</h2>
        <p>Ebooks sound like the ultimate freedom: any book, downloaded immediately to your device at the tap of a finger.
I remember Kindles being a hot holiday gift back when I was in 8th grade (2012), but after only a few months I rarely saw anyone reading one.
Sure enough, e-reader sales peaked in 2011 and have been declining ever since.<sup><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272740/global-shipments-of-e-book-readers/">1</a></sup>
There seem to be a few reasons why e-readers lost their popularity.
Some people don't read at all,<sup><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/23/who-doesnt-read-books-in-america/">2</a></sup> and perhaps those who do would rather read paper than an "e-ink display."
I've personally been frustrated by my library's ebook selection, and the books that do look interesting have already been "checked out" (a silly idea when it's just a file!).
Buying an ebook costs a lot, if not as much as a new paper book than definitely more than a used one.</p>

<p>I'd like to make the case that you should read ebooks.
If you don't own an e-reader already, it's very easy to find someone to give you theirs for free.
Their batteries last for <i>weeks</i>, and they have enough storage for countless titles.
If an e-reader doesn't sound as fantastic to you than it does to me, there are a number of great ebook reader apps available for your smartphone, including the <a href="https://koreader.rocks/">free and open-source KOReader</a>.
Ebooks are very easy to find on the internet, with many classics available for download from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/free-ebooks/">many sites</a>, including <a href="https://standardebooks.org">Standard Ebooks</a>, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/texts">Internet Archive</a>. If you know where to look, any ebook ever created is available online.
There is a fantastic open-source ebook management program called <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> that can keep your ebooks organized, convert them to different formats, sync them with ebook readers, and just about anything else.
If you ever want to send a book to someone, you could do it via email.
I've found a number of open source textbooks available as .epub files, and others can be converted to a format compatible with e-readers.</p>

<p>I enjoy long-distance hiking, and hope to spend as much of my life travelling as I can.
This feels like an elegant solution to the feeling of disconnect I get when I spend so much time alone or far from a library.
I'll have every book I want to read in my pocket (without the actual weight of a stack of books in my bag), I'll be able to spend more time learning, and my smartphone battery will make it to the next outlet without dying.
The only thing I need to work out is how to add books to my Kindle using my smartphone.
When I develop a simple enough workflow, I'll edit this with my findings.
Happy reading!</p>
