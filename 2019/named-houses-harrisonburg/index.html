   <h1>The Named Houses of Harrisonburg</h1>
   October 13, 2018
 	<p>I'm a freshman at JMU, which means that I've been getting acquainted with Harrisonburg over the last couple of months.
 		 One of the things that has stuck out to me is that groups of college students that live together will often give their
 		 house a name, sometimes even making a sign that hangs prominently above the door. Student groups will often pass down
 		 their house's legacy to future members, allowing for houses to acquire nuanced personalities with time. No doubt this
 		 is a common phenomenon in college towns, but I think it's really cool.</p>
 	<p>I got the idea the other day to make a map of the named houses surrounding JMU, which would give me an excuse to try
 		out <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>. I spent a Sunday afternoon walking around the neighborhoods that
 	surround main campus, writing down the name and address of every named house I came across. When I got home I used Google
 	Maps to grab the coordinates for each address, and placed them all as markers into an embedded Leaflet map.</p>
